/**
 * Shared OpenCode key via Daytona secrets (server-only).
 *
 * The shared OpenCode key (see lib/server/opencode-pool) is never handed to a
 * sandbox. Instead a Daytona secret is mounted on it as
 * {@link SECRET_ENV}: the sandbox sees only an opaque placeholder, and
 * Daytona's egress proxy substitutes the real key on HTTPS requests to the
 * secret's allowed hosts (opencode.ai). Printing the env, reading
 * `/proc/<pid>/environ` or running `ps aux` inside the sandbox reveals nothing
 * usable outside it.
 *
 * The placeholder is deliberately NOT mounted as `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, which a
 * plain `opencode` TUI in the sandbox terminal would pick up on its own. Only
 * the agent's process is told where the key is, through an inline
 * `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` override (see {@link applySecretToAgentEnv}) that
 * OpenCode merges over the global opencode.json. That stops casual use, not a
 * determined user — the variable is visible in `env` — which is why the mount
 * also only lives for the duration of a turn.
 *
 * The placeholder still works from anywhere INSIDE the sandbox — the terminal,
 * the OpenCode TUI, a plain curl — and that traffic bypasses metering. So the
 * secret is mounted only for the duration of a turn: {@link mountSharedOpencodeSecret}
 * at send time, {@link releaseSharedOpencodeSecret} wherever a turn ends. Between
 * turns the placeholder is dead weight; the proxy no longer swaps it.
 *
 * The secrets themselves are created from `OPENCODE_API_KEY` on first use
 * ({@link ensureSharedOpencodeSecret}), so there is nothing to set up in the
 * Daytona dashboard.
 *
 * The {@link OPENCODE_SECRET_LABEL} label tracks the state on the sandbox: the
 * mounted secret's name during a turn, {@link DETACHED} between turns, absent
 * on sandboxes that have never had a secret. Daytona behaviours this works
 * around:
 * - A sandbox created WITHOUT any secrets must be restarted before newly
 *   attached ones work. New sandboxes therefore get the secret at creation
 *   (see {@link opencodeSecretCreateParams}); older ones are restarted once, on
 *   their first shared OpenCode turn. A detached sandbox (label present) is
 *   remounted without one.
 * - A (re)mount reaches the proxy "within seconds", and a mounted env var is
 *   visible only to processes spawned after it. The agent is spawned fresh
 *   each turn; {@link waitForSecretPropagation} covers the proxy delay.
